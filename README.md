# Howler

School assignment, a basic client-side rendered social media network page (It's simplified Twitter). Users can log in, view posts of users they follow, follow and unfollow users, and view profiles.

The frontend is written in HTML and CSS, using bootstrap to help. The backend is written in JS.

REST API was designed and written by myself to fit the requirements of the project.

### TODO:  
Fix bugs with howl times: howls are sometimes posted out of order due to simultaneous GET calls
Proper authentication: Done with only username right now
